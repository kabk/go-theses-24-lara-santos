				Santas<br>
				lioness horse<br>
				who rides calmly<br>
				and devours men<br>

				What comes out of her mouth<br>
				it also runs down your ass<br>
				your tail shouldn't be tied up<br>
				stuck tail holds the throat<br>
				<br>
				and saints need to growl shout<br>
				<br>
				Santas has to keep her tail loose<br>
				to do what she was born to do<br>
				be free, enchanted, and dignified<br>
				for the right to speak and dance<br>
				<br>
				She has spiritual permission<br>
				to engage in unacceptable behavior<br>
				She runs free, looks crazy, and doesn't hesitate<br>
				<br>
				Not afraid of anyone<br>
				She is shameless<br>
				Nothing stops her<br>
				<br>
				Killer<br>
				She kicks you<br>
				CRAU!<br>
				<br>
				Kill you!<br>
				In self-defense!<br>
				<br>
				She will kill you<br>
				dancing and throwing smiles<br>
				<br>
				Improvisation is her power.<br>
				And when she dances she exposes herself<br>
				No distortion suppress, Santas<br>

				</summary>

				<p> Dribble: as in dodging, swinging the body as a strategy for moving forward; getting away from
					obstacles.
				</p>
				<p>
					Graphics: as a means of registering the flow and movement of the body through words, images, vectors
					and signs.

				</p>
				<p>
					Loose body: is the presence of the body in performance. Emancipated. In its freedom to communicate
					its knowledge through body language.
				</p>
				<p>
					I wish good meetings to everyone who will read this text, may the words be alive and fruitful. Let
					this
					text be placed on the ground. May it mark once and for all my enchanted territory, the known body. I
					chose to write it so I remember it. For the opposite of this, is disenchantment, it means conforming
					to
					the countless stories told about my body intending to dominate it, civilize it, and silence it.
				</p>
				<p>
					About reminders for me, motivations for doing this: for a long time I practiced neglecting the body,
					that is, I left my body aside, until it became super difficult to hear it, even to know it. This
					dynamic
					is a problem that affects many people. In my story, I see that this distancing from the body was
					conducted within different structures, reinforcing lies and universal formulas of sanctity,
					progress,
					and civilization.
				</p>
				<p>
					Introducing the body that speaks to you, I am Lara Santos, a black, Brazilian, and queer woman, I am
					a
					multidisciplinary graphic designer, who strategically deals with graphic design as a tool to bring
					together bodies, to record and publish their knowledge. It is important to highlight that
					singularity is
					a fundamental point here, considering a movement against homogenization.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is a way around these lies told about the body. This piece of writing reflects on how the body
					is
					in confrontation with choreographies of social norms that say the body needs to be contained, and
					controlled. The schism is what is the body's repertoire. If the body speaks, what are the
					relationships
					between the body and graphic design?
				</p>

				<p>So let's go. May I be filled with the desire to write, may I be able to awaken what has been dormant
					over time. May here be nothing more than the lifelong authorization to say words without fear of the
					language not being formatted for everyone's understanding. May the word and the body not be
					separated
					for communication.
				</p>

				<p>

					Below I present to whoever is reading, the path of my curiosity between the body and its knowledge,
					concerning words, and graphic design. I expose the path of becoming aware of how both transport
					epistemes, that is, they transport knowledge. I write through references, to authors, artists,
					designers, interviews, and experiences, which inspired me in my positions and gave me the procedure
					to
					write here. I thank and honor each name mentioned here. Maximum respect and affection for the
					knowledge
					of the people I mention in this text. May we have open chests for this journey!
				</p>

				<p>
					“Memory is the contents of a continent – its life, its history, its past. As if the body were the
					document. It’s no wonder that dance for black people is a movement of liberation.”
					– Beatriz Nascimento

				</p>
				<p>
					I am part of a large family, most of my relatives are concentrated in the state of Rio de Janeiro,
					more precisely in Campos dos Goytacazes. I call them a reference because what I present in this text
					is closely related to what I learned from them. Our family gatherings are fundamental, dancing is a
					sacred tradition in our encounters, and this has always been my reference.


				</p>
				<p>
					At Christmas 2024 I got together with some of my family, the sun was shining and everyone was by the
					pool. There was me, my mother, my uncle Carlinhos, my uncle Amaro, my aunt Celeste, my aunt Celi,
					Tia Carmem, who arrived later, and my cousin Mariana, who was a mermaid at the edge of the pool. I
					took advantage of the moment to bring up a subject I had been meaning to discuss with them.

				</p>

				<p>
					Without hesitation, I asked the first question:
				</p>

				<p>
				<h3 id="interview">
					Lara: Why is dancing important to our family?
					Dora: I have a memory of us dancing in the back of the house in Texeira de Melo, in Campos dos
					Goytacazes.
					Celi: Lots of music, the family has always been passionate about parties and dancing.
					Celeste: Lots of samba
					Amaro: Because dancing lifts your spirits.
					Celeste: Free.
					Lara: Yeah…Free from what?
					Amaro: frees you from the stress of everyday life, work, and little money.
					Dora: Dancing is freedom. And there are places I go that I don't want to dance. Get up and move. For
					me, dancing means exposing yourself. You know… these work parties, when samba plays, people expect
					me to dance. "Look, the black woman who dances." I'm not going to give that stage, I'm not going to
					samba driven by that kind of expectation. I don't feel like it.
					Celeste: I was shy, dancing freed me, loosened me up.
					Celi: I feel like a bird and let myself be carried away by the rhythm.
					Carlos: Samba is part of our ancestry, right? Dancing expresses where you come from. It's spiritual,
					dancing until you reach Zen.
					Amaro: Dancing prepares me physically. Dancing leaves the body loose, otherwise, the body becomes
					trapped, and shrunken.

					</summary>
					<p>
						I look for the forces that shrink my body in order to deviate from them. I look at the testimony
						of my life and I analyse that the different institutions I have passed through have imposed a
						mentality that preserves oppressive "norms" that hurt my existence. Norms that force me to
						conform to what is "acceptable". I'm talking about the institutions that exist to worship the
						taste of whiteness and erase the memory of the body.
