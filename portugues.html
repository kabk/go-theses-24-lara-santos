				<p> The focus of this text is to legitimise the body as a terrain of knowledge in physical and digital
					spaces". What is repeated in the body and the voice is also an episteme," according to thinker Leda
					Maria Martins. A discussion on the (dis)connection to the body emerges from the remix of lived
					experience, family dialogues, theory and graphic memory: curated found images that reflect research
					on
					how bodies can write in the digital environment. Here the notion of the body, choreography and
					writing
					as a means of communication meet. The body is charged with the power to dismantle Eurocentric
					conventions that have marginalised oral and physical knowledge from graphic design education.</p>

						I wish everyone who reads this text good encounters, may the words become alive and fruitful.
						May
						this text be placed on the floor. May it mark once and for all my enchanted territory, the known
						body. I have chosen to write it so that I don't forget it. For the opposite of this is
						disenchantment. It means conforming to the countless stories told about my body in order to
						dominate, civilize and silence it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Presenting the body you speak of, I am Lara Santos, a black cisgender queer woman from Brazil.
						My
						multidisciplinary work strategically engages with graphic design as a means to bring bodies
						together
						to record their graphic discourse and publish their knowledge. It is important to emphasise that
						subjectivity is a fundamental point here, considering a movement against homogenisation in
						favour of
						multiplicity.
					</p>
					<p>
						About the motivations for doing this: for a long time I practiced neglecting the body, that is,
						leaving my body aside, until it became very difficult to hear it, even to know it. This dynamic
						is a
						problem that affects a lot of people. In my story, I see that this distancing from the body has
						taken place within different structures, reinforcing lies and universal formulas of holiness,
						progress and civilization.
					</p>
					<p>
						This text is the way around these lies told about the body. It reflects on how the body is in
						confrontation with choreographies made up of social norms that say the body must be contained
						and
						controlled. I focus on what is the repertoire of the body. If the body speaks, what are the
						relationships between the body and graphic design? How do you write with the body?
					</p>

					<p>So let's go. May I be filled with the desire to write. May I be able to awaken what has been
						decorated with time? May this be nothing more than the lifelong authorization to say words
						without
						fear that the language won't be formatted for everyone's understanding. That the word and the
						body
						are not separated in communication.
					</p>

					<p>

						Below I present to the reader the route of my journey to find the body and its knowledge. I
						present
						the path of becoming aware of how both (the body and graphic design) transport epistemes.
					</p>
					<p>I write through a mix of references, authors, artists, designers, interviews, memories and
						experiences that have given me the procedure to write here. I honour every name mentioned here.
						Maximum respect and affection for the contribution of the people I mention in this text.
					</p>
					<p>May we have an open mind for this journey.</p>

						I am part of a large family, most of my relatives are concentrated in the state of Rio de
						Janeiro,
						more precisely in Campos dos Goytacazes. I call them a reference because what I present in this
						text
						is closely related to what I learned from them. Our family gatherings are fundamental, dancing
						is a
						sacred tradition in our encounters, and this has always been my reference. </p>
					<p>
						At Christmas 2024 I got together with some of my family, the sun was shining and everyone was by
						the
						pool. There was me, my mother, my uncle Carlinhos, my uncle Amaro, my aunt Celeste, my aunt
						Celi,
						Tia Carmem, who arrived later, and my cousin Mariana, who was a mermaid at the edge of the pool.
						I
						took advantage of the moment to bring up a subject I had been meaning to discuss with them</p>

					<p>
						Without hesitation, I asked the first question:
					</p>

					<p>

					<p class="interview">
						<br>
						<span class="quote">LARA:</span> Why is dancing important to our family?<br>
						<br>
						<span class="quote">DORA:</span> I have a memory of us dancing in the back of the house in

						<br>
						<span class="quote">CELI:</span> Lots of music, the family has always been passionate about

						<br>

						<span class="quote">LARA:</span> Yeah…Free from what?<br>
						<br>
						<span class="quote">AMARO:</span> frees you from the stress of everyday life, work, and little
						money.<br>
						<br>
						<span class="quote">DORA:</span> Dancing is freedom. And there are places I go that I don't want
						to
						dance. Get up and move. For
						me, dancing means exposing yourself. You know… these work parties, when samba plays, people
						expect
						me to dance. "Look, the black woman who dances." I'm not going to give that stage, I'm not going
						to
						samba driven by that kind of expectation. I don't feel like it.<br>
						<br>
						<span class="quote">CELESTE:</span> I was shy, dancing freed me, loosened me up.<br>
						<br>
						<span class="quote">CELI:</span> I feel like a bird and let myself be carried away by the

						<br>
						<span class="quote">CARLINHOS:</span> <span id="Graphics">samba</span> is part of our ancestry,
						right? Dancing expresses where you
						come from. It's spiritual,

						<br>
						<span class="quote">AMARO:</span> Dancing prepares me physically. Dancing leaves the body loose,
						otherwise, the body becomes
						trapped, and shrunken.<br>
						<br>
						<span class="Graphics">[cut]</span>

					</p>
					<p>
						I would like to reflect on this concept that my uncle Amaro taught us: "Dancing prepares us
						physically, dancing makes our body loose" - this is wisdom! - The loose body is the body in the
						presence, without shame, protected even when exposed, ready to evade and counterattack, in tune
						with
						its intuition, which feels the freedom to express itself!

					</p>

					<p>
						Just imagine! On a sunny day, a black woman, 80 years old, with gold chains around her neck and
						sparkling earrings, with a ponytail, with a bright and sharp look. She gets up from her chair
						and
						starts dancing, with a smile on her face, her hips swaying from side to side. She looks at you
						and
						invites you to dance, laughing quietly, and you can only watch as she is surrounded by the
						rhythm of
						the samba that drives her. She plays and plays with her gestures, with her facial expressions,
						with
						her short movements, interwoven with <span class="Graphics">sapiência</span>.
					</p>

					<p>
						<span class="quote">
							"Dance is the ideal medium for the intellect-body to perform its inventions. It is the
							perfect
							space
							for the creation of gestures: favorably permeable to the movements that inhabit the life
							going
							on
							inside the body and simultaneously willing to work them in plastic and expressive terms in
							an
							attempt to achieve aesthetic syntheses that can impact the senses and transcend the
							utilitarianism
							that saturates contemporary experiences–which so frequently subjugates the body." – Danilo
							de
							Miranda, "A living library of gestures"
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						The wisdom of dancing to have a physically prepared body is a daily coping strategy. A loose
						body
						goes into battle, into confrontation, it is concentrated. A weapon body, a vital body, an
						enchanted
						body that remains connected to its roots, its history and its ancestry.
					</p>
					<p>
						On the other hand, the trapped body is the sleeping body, left aside, forgotten, apathetic,
						unprepared, detached from itself, closed, that is, an "obedient" body, but fragmented by
						distortions, subdued by prejudices.

					</p>
					<p>
						Everything is recorded in the body, the body registers information about its socio-political
						context. It is like a platform for disseminating knowledge through the means of movement, which
						informs in the same way as writing. Like a collection, it stores stories, traumas and symbols.
					</p>

					<p>
						The performing body transmits data. When dancing, content is expressed - the memory process is
						triggered by movement - like a sponge, the body retains memories. <br>
						I seek awareness of the above repertoire of embodied knowledge to empower myself, to let my body
						be
						loose, free.

						I look for the forces that shrink my body in order to deviate from them. I look at the testimony
						of
						my life and I analyse that the different institutions I have passed through have imposed a
						mentality
						that preserves oppressive "norms" that hurt my existence. Norms that force me to conform to what
						is
						"acceptable". I'm talking about the institutions that exist to worship the taste of whiteness
						and
						erase the memory of the body.


					</p>

					<p>
						In this context, I remember being motivated by pastors to silence me, to give up parts of myself
						that were synonymous with "sinful and negative" behaviour. To illustrate, I remember being
						advised
						by a pastor to delete a photo of me playing capoeira from my Instagram. He explained that
						because it
						was a cultural expression related to Afro-Brazilian rituals, the photo was a negative symbol and
						should be deleted because I was part of that institutional community.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, this illusion, based on racism, only served to imprison my body and empty my perception
						of
						what capoeira means. The torture of the constant disciplining of the body atrophies the
						relationship
						of trust with it.

					</p>
					<p>
						Let's think about the memories inscribed in the body. But be careful, because in contrast to
						Western
						traditions that emphasise the recording of memory strictly through words. Here, with the writer
						Leda
						Maria Martins as a reference, I welcome the notions that recognise the body, with all its
						diversity
						of knowledge, as significant in the inscription, production and dissemination of knowledge.
						Therefore, the mastery of an alphabetically written language is not decisive for the inscription
						of
						knowledge.
					</p>

					<p>
						Access to written discursive language is a privilege and has long been a tool used by the
						hegemonic
						social class in the service of its self-promotion, its domination, invested in the
						disqualification
						of other ways of producing knowledge, including those carried out through the body.
					</p>

					<p>
						According to Leda Maria Martins, African bodies displaced to the Americas expressed their
						knowledge
						primarily through bodily performances. In her book <span class="quote"> Performances do Tempo
							Espiralar: poéticas do
							corpo-tela, she writes: "The word was danced, the gesture was sung, in every movement there
							was
							a
							choreography of the voice, a score of diction, a graffiti pigmentation of the skin, a
							sonority
							of
							colour".</span>
					</p>

					<p>
						In this way, the treatment of the body as an episteme can refer both to the subjective knowledge
						of
						this experience lived internally and to the body's broader structure in relation to the world,
						its
						socio-cultural historical context. This leads me to conclude that knowledge of the body, memory
						in
						all its vastness, provides me with material for institutional emancipation. <span
							class="quote">"What is repeated in the
							body and voice is also an episteme".</span>

					</p>

					<p>
						On the other hand, the status quo that represents the colonisers in the Americas, during and
						after
						the colonial period, launched various attacks on African and indigenous bodies, using the most
						diverse instruments of domination. For example, the religion that turned rites into sins, the
						laws
						that banned samba and capoeira. The police that killed and continue to kill black children. Is
						the
						distortion of history that authorises the illusory narrative of white supremacy, which does not
						refer to itself, but is based on "othering" to maintain its social privilege. But I do not
						propose
						to enter into that discussion here.

					</p>

					<p>
						<span class="quote">"The body is a place of memory, and in it are inscribed the experiences
							lived
							and updated in
							everyday life. The body as a totality of knowledge, perceived integrally, was abandoned and
							split,
							de-interlaced from the brain for a long time. The aphorism “I think therefore I am” leaves
							deep
							marks on our imagination about the body, making us believe that the body is not a way of
							thinking,
							that the body “does not know."
							-Luciane Ramos Silva
						</span>
					</p>

					<p>
						Although it is not a central theme of this text, the unconditional value of rationalism must be
						deliberately reduced here, because it makes us <span class="quote">"swell our minds until we
							forget
							our bodies"(Luiz
							Rufino)</span> said. The fight against forgetting is an affirmative action. In this way, I
						call
						for
						rationalisation to reduce to the point until it is no longer superior to body awareness.
					</p>

					<p>
						Finally, I would like to make it clear that the body travels in different dimensions here, it
						can be
						the body as a physical, carnal apparatus. It can be the body that has lived on this ground that
						we
						are now walking on and that is now being traversed by history (Archive). Another possible
						dimension
						here is
						the witnessing body,(container) the body that contains embedded knowledge. The collective body
						shares
						experience with its network, which is in relationship with itself, with others and with its
						context.
						The body image, which is visual and aesthetic, creates images. The body in displacement, in
						flow, in
						performance, loose...

						Emory Douglas (1943) was an American graphic artist. He is known also for his work as minister

					<p> <span class="Graphics">[ponte]</span>

					<p>
						It's really good to invent bridges, to make transformations, to deliberately bring together
						fields
						of knowledge that are supposedly distant. Approximation allows us to see movements that coexist;
						this gesture opens up ways of deviating from monolingual regimes, that is, from beliefs that
						rigidify and standardise ways of producing knowledge.
					</p>
					<p>In this chapter, I want to continue thinking about the body in performance at the centre of
						everything, including graphic design, my main field of activity. For this reason, the effort
						here is
						to expand the notion of knowledge distribution, which I believe is the point where the body and
						graphic design come together, despite their differences.</p>

					<p>
						Graphic design is a technological means of communication, responsible for creating visual
						systems
						and distributing information. It is also a professional category, i.e. a work that has an impact
						(micro or macro) on the public sphere, whether in the context of culture, the market,
						aesthetics,
						the economy, communication, history or education. This awareness of the social place that the
						designer occupies is essential, as it allows for a discussion of how this being has the
						potential
						and authority to restrict and/or induce the movement of bodies.

					<p>
						The approach to graphic design in the educational institutions I have attended still reinforces
						an
						illusion that deals with what has been created in Europe as a reference for imposed standards.
						The
						history of design is still at the service of Europe, and therefore the academy, on the basis of
						difference, distances itself from information about bodies because they are outside the canon of
						design.
					</p>
					<p>
						The body as a subject is silenced in graphic design. Be it the body of the subject who creates,
						or
						the body affected by the authority of this discipline. Thus, attention to these bodies is
						insufficient.
					</p>
					<p>
						These dialogues, absent in the classroom, lead to the predictable, to the trapped body (trigger
						and
						rage). The narrative struggle continues. </p>

					<p>
						Through the body, I see the possibility of overflowing the
						control mechanisms applied by the industry of myths of whiteness that serve to satisfy its own
						appetite. But now, I'm the one who's going to eat, and I'm not alone!
					</p>
					<p>
						With my body loose, I enter this game, looking for the interaction between body language and
						graphic
						language, to write and say much more than standard forms allow.
					</p>
					<p>

						How does graphic design affect bodies, and how can bodies move/affect graphic design? Those were
						the
						questions that started my concern and continues to guide me in the search for images that
						reflect
						graphic discourses that transpose the constructions that trap the body.

					</p>
					<p>

						Based on the questions above, I would like to consider the tensions between body and word in
						three
						ways:

					</p>
					<p class="interview">
						<br>
						- First, I want to look at the position of graphic design, especially typography, and access to
						writing techniques.<br>
						<br>

						- Secondly, I will focus on the graphic memory that reflects the habits of a territory and
						registers
						the presence of the body in the field of visual communication. A small selection of graphic
						compositions collected during my journey.<br>
						<br>
						- In the third way, I present an experiment in which I strategically propose to hack typography
						to
						write with the body in the digital environment.<br>

					</p>


				</details>

				<details>

						<h2 id="chapter3">TiPOGRAFiA COMO iMAGEM PENSANTE</h2>
					</summary>
					<p>
						The graphic designer, broadly speaking, is responsible for articulating relationships between
						people
						and information through visual communication projects. We (designers) can have different
						professional responsibilities, but here I want to focus on typography and the management of
						written
						and verbal language.
					</p>
					<p>
						In short, typography is the alphabet taken to a certain level of abstraction. The typographer,
						in
						turn, is responsible for organising the information on the page in order to publish it, through
						the
						mastery of printing techniques, whether analogue or digital, which vary according to the era and
						the
						resources available.
					</p>

					<p>
						The practice of printing with movable type was officially introduced in Brazil in 1808, when the
						Portuguese Court moved to Rio de Janeiro. It is undeniable that a typographic tradition was
						established at that time, standardising the appearance of letters, implying the sophistication
						of
						type production, and influencing the verbal graphic language and control over it.
					</p>

					<p>
						According to Leda Maria Martins, the mastery of writing techniques played an essential role in
						the
						exclusion, erasure and silencing of the knowledge of the colonised by the Europeans.<span
							class="quote">"Alphabetic
							writing was installed as an instrument of exclusion, segregation and stigmatisation. It was
							not
							an
							addition or a complement, but rather an imposition, an exclusive means of dissemination, as
							well
							as
							the values it disseminated, be they social, religious, behavioural or world-views". </span>
					</p>

					<p>
						The manipulation of the alphabet - whether within the typographic tradition or in poetic,
						vernacular, experimental forms, calligraphy, on the street, in a notebook, on the screen - are
						gestures that are embedded in the way we inscribe ourselves in time and in the way we relate to
						living knowledge in words.
					</p>

					<p>
						<span class="quote">
							speak = voice (oral culture)
							write = manuscript (manuscript culture)
							type = digitus (digital culture)

							Source: Writing as language technology, by Cristiane Dias
						</span>

					</p>

					<p>
						Typography is a thinking image, which means that there is a flow of thought in typography. The
						word
						produces something about what it represents and through the affection it has in the
						reader/viewer,
						and also involves the thoughts of those who produced and/or reproduced it. So typography is an
						image
						of thought because it involves the positions of those who have manipulated it, those who have
						interpreted it and those who read/see it.

						In principle, writing is a necessity because it symbolises the preservation of a people's
						cultural
						memory, resistance and resilience. Since the end of the 1980s, the "access" to alphabetic
						writing
						through typography has gained more space in emerging countries with the "popularisation" of
						digital
						technologies. The digital environment therefore facilitates a response to the legacy of
						exclusion of
						pre-digital methods of producing and publishing knowledge.

					</p>

					<p>
						Reflecting on the concept of graphic discourse - as a powerful tool for disseminating embodied
						knowledge - deliberately brings the body into the discussion, as well as its care with design
						technologies. Technologies that open up space for the writing/rewriting of history, recorded as
						graphic memory.

						Yhuri Cruz (1991) is an artist from Olaria, Rio de Janeiro. His work comes from the field of
						memory,
						exploring ways to re-historicise the past through the invention of new myths. "Monument to the
						Voice
						of Anastácia" is a work that rescues and recreates her image. Anastácia has been massively
						represented with a mask covering her mouth, as a symbol of silencing in the collective
						imagination.
						Through Yhuri's ability with digital technologies, he uncovers the veiled mouth and celebrates
						her
						voice.
					</p>
					<p> <span class="Graphic"> Anastácia Livre</span> is presented in the printed form of a little
						saint–a
						small two-sided printed flyer –
						the format most commonly used by churches and political campaigns. The little saint (santinho)
						was
						massively distributed and by 2020 was already part of school history textbooks.</p>

					<p>
						In light of the above, the intentional care of graphic design tools is a strategy for unlearning
						the
						discourses that promote the symbolic, aesthetic, and institutional continuities of colonial
						relations of domination over the body.

						Typography in the broadest sense is found in several places, this tool reflects worldviews,
						moves
						bodies, indicates flows of people and facilitates the gathering of bodies, both physically and
						digitally. The aim is to expose graphic memory, taking into account that the intimate
						relationship
						with images triggers memory.
					</p>
					<p>
						Likewise, typography as a thinking image takes into account the flows of interaction between the
						body and the image. It also takes into account the affection that graphic language has for the
						public, that is, the active role it plays in the daily life of society.

					</p>
					<p>
						Graphic memory brings me closer to the sites of production and dissemination of black
						aesthetic-cultural knowledge in order to rethink the history of graphic design and its legacy.
					</p>
					<p>Below I present a collection of images that I have grouped together during my research and that
						reflect the points made in this text, graphics that open windows to see beyond standard forms,
						images loaded with context and technology.</p>

					</p>
					<p>
						In light of all that has been said, I would like to briefly touch on my research, still in its
						infancy, into the practicalities of writing with the body in the digital environment.
					</p>
					<p>
						The act of hacking typography, guided by the spirit of disobedience to typographic traditions
						that bind the body, means strategically decomposing the letter and transforming it into an image
						beyond the lexical or the intelligible. This effort is aimed at bringing the body closer to
						(characters/orthography/calligraphy/type) to transmit knowledge. After the first research
						process, I noticed that the result tends to be an abstraction of the standard forms of the
						letter, because of the space that the presence of the body occupies in the letter.

					</p>

					<p>
						Symbolically, this process represents the intervention of dance as a trigger to inscribe bodies
						in typography. A freely accessible counter tool that legitimises the knowledge of the body and
						takes it deeply into account in order to invent.

					<p>
						The images above represent the process of creating the typography for the visual communication
						of "Set", a multilingual hip-hop concert performed by Thabata Lorena, the rapper who has her
						dancing body inscribed on the letters. In this work I have applied my research, which is at an
						early stage, the steps I have followed are
					</p>

					<p>
						<br>

						Step 1. Dancing, following the body in performance, witnessing the dance, gathering with other
						bodies, celebrating;<br>
						<br>

						Step2. Collect all visual records of the bodies: video, photos, notes/handwriting,
						interviews;<br>
						<br>
						Step 3. Select the sample that will be the repetitive unit that will serve as the basis for the
						composition;<br>
						<br>
						Step 4. With malice, experiment with the repetition of units, spaces, scales, colours, signs and
						compositions.<br>
						<br>
						Step 5. Hack typography: write messages and add codes. Time to give meaning to symbols and apply
						typography to some physical and/or digital support.
						<br>
						</span>
					</p>

					<p>
						(DANCE+WORD), (BODY+MEMORY), (CONTENT+FORM) = N

					</p>
					<p>
						Here is the constant in the method I use to achieve the abstraction of the letter, this unknown
						consists of cutting out fragments of the body's movement to invent a letter, a symbol, an image,
						or a pattern. In translation, this process reminds me of the gesture of sampling, separating a
						sample from the movement and drawing with it to invent a new composition, an image, a rhythm…


					</p>

					<p>
						This sample is transformed when repeated, and even when placed in a different context, it still
						carries the reference of the original movement, which passes through the designer's care to form
						a new image.


					</p>
					<p>
						Sampling typography (N) is a careful process, you need the ability to transform the sample, and
						this is the spirit that drives the flow of thoughts on the graphic composition.

						To conclude this text, I would like to share a memory, a phrase I heard from <span
							class="quote">Rodrigo Rodms</span>, a
						Brazilian professor, editor and graphic designer from Rio de Janeiro. In the first course I took
						with him, <span class="quote"> "Negritude in the Thread of Design History"</span>, he said that
						his goal was <span class="quote">"to fight for
							an education that interests black people".</span> That phrase has stayed with me ever since.

					</p>

					<p>
						The movement to centralise the body in graphic design was the strategy I found to make this
						study autonomous and to address my concerns about design education, as a motivation through
						proximity to the displaced. Thus, a gesture of self-repair, focusing on the body's repertoire
						and its poetics, was the way to create/study design with a loose body.


					</p>
					<p>
						Finally, I would like to conclude this nostalgic reminder, which celebrates continuity, of the
						processes of rescuing the body's memory, thus recognising its capacity for historical resistance
						and its intuitive power to create and publish resurgent images that transpose the constructions
						that imprison the body.

					</p>

					<p>
						<span class="quote">

							“In fact, working in the territory of memory is to reaffirm that it is not just about
							remembrance or interpretation. Memory is also a symbolic construction, by a collective that
							reveals and attributes values to past experience and reinforces community bonds. And memory
							can also be a review of the narrative about the “victorious” past of a people, revealing
							anti-humanitarian acts they committed – which elites often want to erase or forget.” - Cida
							Bento, in Narcissistic Pact of Whiteness.
